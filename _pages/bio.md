Not really sure what to put here. I'm a 23 year-old living in the suburbs of Seattle. I work at Microsoft and I love cars. But I set a goal to fill this page...

I wish I could say I was born in a log cabin in the middle of Winter under some extraordinary circumstances. I grew up in the safe and suburban town of Novato, California... otherwise known as "the gateway to wine country". (Yes, that is actually the town motto.) It really is quite a beautiful town with rolling hills that alternate between deep greens in the Winter and rolling hills of amber in the summer months.
