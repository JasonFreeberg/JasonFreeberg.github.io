Hi there! I am a recent graduate from UC Santa Barbara, now living in the suburbs of Seattle. I work at Microsoft and I love cars, hiking, and non-fiction. I started this blog because I realized after college that writing things down is a great way to solidify what you're learning when there aren't any exams or homework!

I studied Statistics and Technology Management in college, but my college years were largely defined by founding and growing the university's Data Science club and competing in the yearly startup competition.
