    Hi there! I am a recent graduate from UC Santa Barbara, now living in the suburbs of Seattle. I work at Microsoft
    and I love cars, hiking, and videogames. I started this blog because I realized after college that writing things
    down is a great way to solidify and share what you're learning (especially when there aren't any exams or homework).

    I studied Statistics and Technology Management, but my college years were largely defined by founding and
    growing the university's Data Science club, teaching introductory statistics, and competing in the annual startup competition. When I
    changed my major to statistics, there was no campus organization for students interested in analytics or data
    science. I started club that focused on project-based learning and industry skills. The club took off
    and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DataScienceUCSB/">is still going strong today</a>. During my last year in
    college, I teamed up with my best friends to validate the product-market fit for a juvenile diabetes alerting
    device for UCSB's annual <a href="https://tmp.ucsb.edu/entrepreneurship/new-venture-competition">New Venture Competition</a>.
    It was a
    fantastic learning experience and a great introduction to the concepts of market research and validation.

    Now I work on Azure App Service, a platform for web applications. I mainly work on Java support, deployment
    scenarios,
    and integration with other services like Azure Monitor. Check out my blog posts for tutorials and best practices.
