    Hi there! I am a recent graduate from UC Santa Barbara, now living in the suburbs of Seattle. I work at Microsoft
    and enjoy driving my Miata, hiking, and videogames. I started this blog because writing is a great way to solidify
    and share the things you're learning.
</p>

    I studied Statistics and Technology Management, but my college years were largely defined by founding and
    growing the university's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DataScienceUCSB/">Data Science club</a>, teaching
    introductory statistics, and competing in UCSB's <a href="https://tmp.ucsb.edu/entrepreneurship/new-venture-competition">annual startup competition</a>.
</p>
<p>
    I'm a Program Manager on Azure App Service, a platform for web applications. I drive improvements for Java scenarios, deployment
    stories, and integration with other Azure services. Check out my blog posts for tutorials and best practices.
