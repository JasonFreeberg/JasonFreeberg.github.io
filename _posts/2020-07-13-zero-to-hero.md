Azure App Service is a managed service for hosting web and API applications. It's the product I work on as a Program Manager. With COVID lockdowns in full-effect, a lot of companies are rushing to move their applications to the cloud. My team and I have been working on a new [blog series](https://azure.github.io/AppService/) to help developers get started with App Service. The series starts from zero and starts with how to create your first App Service. From there, it covers Continuous Integration and Delivery, the Migration Assistant, certificates and domains, networking, and more. I will update the list below as new articles are posted.
